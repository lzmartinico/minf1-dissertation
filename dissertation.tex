\abstract{
Increases in smartphone usage have made recording habits easy for anyone, enabling self-tracking of vitals and preventive medicine applications. Effective results have been achieved with food logging, but the User Experience (UX) of mainstream applications is still not perfect. We propose and describe the implementation of a conversational interface for meal tracking, which combines features of modern messaging platforms to enable capturing food via text or images, and give verbal feedback about nutrition. We enumerate some structural issues that complicate a successful implementation and our attempts to address these problems. To measure the effectiveness of our solutions, we conducted a user trial, comparing the chatbot with a popular meal logging application. Despite some disappointing results in its usability,  we highlight evidence that a conversational interface might eventually be successful in this area, and some proposals for future directions of reseach. However, in light of recent events, we recommend that future work first take into account the confidentiality of user data.
