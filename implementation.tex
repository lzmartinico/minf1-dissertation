\section{Design}
As a dialogue agent, a chatbot needs to be designed for conversation with a human user, each turn in the exchange supplying or retrieving information from the system.

To determine what kind of interactions the users and the chatbot should have, we started our design phase using the Botmock\footnote{botmock.com} tool to draft some conversation graphs. Botmock is a simple web application that allows its users to draw textboxes on a canvas and connect them to form a flow diagram, using a library of design elements that are adapted from popular chat interfaces, to give the impression that each box is part of a chatbot conversation.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}
One consideration when determining the tonality of our conversation sketches was what personality the chatbot should exhibit. Given the novelty of the medium in its modern form, we still lack comprehensive guidelines to craft what conversing with a bot should ``feel'' like, although as more chatbots are designed and deployed, some heuristics are beginning to emerge \cite{jessie}. Since chatbots users have shown to appreciate the fun aspect of designed chatbot personalities \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-67744-6_28}, we tried to imbue our conversations with some colloquial aspects, like using slang, calling the user names, and using emojis. \\
As final touches in the design, we added some level or randomisation to the stock responses we had written, to make sure the chatbot did not feel repetitive, especially for frequent expressions. We also provided our bot with a cartoonish image of a robot (available on the internet under a free license) as a profile picture, and gave it the name \textit{Healthbot}, to give people an impression of talking with a real Facebook user.
\subsection{User functionality}
To establish a level of familiarity, rather than fetching a user's name from the client's account information, we initiate our first conversation by asking the user how they would like to be called. The rest of the introductory messages just describe the chatbot's functionalities.\\
Besides asking for help, users have three main available actions they can take: tell the chatbot what they are eating, send a picture of food, and ask the chatbot to recap what they had on a specific date. If the user doesn't specify a quantity or measurement to their meal, the chatbot will ask for details. To avoid bogging down the user with measuring their portions, and since we mostly want them to think about their diet in general terms, we encourage the use of relative rather than absolute quantities (\textit{more, less, same as usual}). We hope that using these measurements we will be able to maintain longer term user engagement, without sacrificing understanding of how much food is being consumed. Once we have this information, we send it through the Nutritionix API, to find out the nutritional content of that meal. \\
Sending a picture to the chatbot triggers a call to the \textit{clarifai} vision API, to understand what the contents of the image is, using their food model \cite{clarifaifood}. \textit{clarifai} returns a list of guesses for a picture, and their confidence value. If only one guess has confidence above the arbitrary threshold of 97\%, we save the food in the picture in our database; in any other case, we present the user with a list of the top three guesses as interactive buttons, so we can store the correct value in the database. 
\subsection{Nutritional analysis}
Once the user starts logging details about their food consumption, we will need to start analysing what they are eating to give them advice. Lacking comprehensive nutritional knowledge, the best we can do is crafting some elementary heuristics. 

The food retrieval intent queries the chatbot's database for all foods stored on a certain date. To aid user's reflection, we provide some basic data analysis, specifically on the food's quantity: 
\begin{itemize}
\item if there are more than 10 foods logged, with at least one having been consumed in large quantities and less than $\frac{2}{3}$ consumed in small quantities, we warn the user they might be overeating
\item if more than $\frac{2}{3}$ of a users' total logged foods on the day are smaller portions than usual, or if they have eaten less than 3 foods, we warn them about undereating. If the food log requested is for the current date, however, a small number of foods could be caused not by undereating, but from the user not having logged their meals yet. In this case, we send no warning if the time is before 10 PM
\end{itemize}

One example of food category that is often praised by dietitians for its high nutritional value \cite{bishoppgreens} is leafy green vegetables. To demonstrate the capabilities of chatbots as nutritional advisers, we handcrafted a list of leafy greens, which we try to match with every meal. If we do not observe the user eating any of these foods in 2 days, we prod them with a reminder. \\
Prodding in a chatbot context requires finding a very delicate balance: it can be too infrequent, making it less useful for users who are interested in being reminded; but if too frequent, it  might soon become annoying. For example, the Forksy nutritional chatbot \cite{forksywebsite} sends a reminder to record your food for every single meal (at least 3 a day). This causes the bot to feel overbearing, and it might actually drive the user away. Forksy's solution is asking the user what time they want to receive their next reminder; but if no food is logged, it gives no option to deactivate reminders completely, and keeps asking for meals every day of inactivity. \\
We attempted to solve this problem by staggering the no usage messages at increasing intervals, first after one day of inactivity, then on the second day, and after that the fourth, seventh and fifteenth, to maximise our chances of getting a forgetful user to start messaging again, without being too annoying if they choose not to. Larger amount of data analysis might be used in the future to determine when, based on current dietary habits or external inputs, the notification might be more effective in nudging the user into resuming logging or eating vegetables, and eventually provide an overall more active prompting system that takes into account correct dietary practices.

\section{Architecture}
Our chatbot's architecture is composed of a natural language interface in \textit{Google Dialogflow}, hooking up to an \textit{Express.js} server running a \textit{Heroku} instance, storing data on a hosted \textit{MongoDB}, and retrieving other information from external APIs. \\
The agent itself is served as a bot on Facebook Messenger. While there are many possible client integrations for Dialogflow, and we considered using \textit{Slack} as a distribution channel because of its first class support for bot users. Eventually we chose Facebook for its popularity, as it allowed us to serve the bot to any of its billion users without them having to install any additional software.
\subsection{Dialogflow components}
There are several Natural Language Understanding platform specifically designed to create and deploy chatbots easily and quickly. Our choice fell on \textit{Google Dialogflow} (at the time \textit{API.AI}), because of its ease of integrations with most popular messaging platform, ease of development, responsiveness and solid NLP functionality. 

A Dialogflow agent is set up with a library of patterns, \textit{intents}, that use example sentences or templates to parse inputs to the chatbot. Templates include parameters whose types are called \textit{entities}, some of which are already defined by Dialogflow, but new ones can also be added by the programmer. One of the standout capabilities of Dialogflow is that a parameter can be marked as required by the intent, so if the initial utterance does not contain it, the chatbot will prompt the user to specify the new parameter. \\
To maintain the flow of conversation, an intent can be followed by another, based on what the user replies, with a context object which stores all parameters passed from the original intent down to all its followups. \\
Each intent can trigger an immediate response, as defined on the Dialogflow console, or it can trigger an \textit{Action} to be fulfilled by the \textit{Webhook}. \textit{Actions} are functions held on the server that can access the parameters of the current intent, execute their own logic, call external APIs etc. They usually are triggered as a POST request to the webhook's address, with the request JSON object as its body. The HTTP response determines the behaviour of the chatbot, either by replying with more text, sending media or rich text, or triggering an \textit{event}, which executes an intent just as if one of the triggering sentences had been sent by the user. \\
Small talk intents are also defined as part of Dialogflow to take care of common sentences unrelated to the chatbot domain. Dialogflow's machine learning engine can be interacted with through a Training console (still in Beta at the time of writing), which can be used to correct intent and parameter recognition (and indirectly, to gain insight into how the engine's model classifies new text).

Our chatbot defines the following intents:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{First interaction} is the initial intent, triggered by the Facebook Messenger "Get Started" button or with the "Greetings" keyword for debugging purposes. This asks the user what their name is, and is followed up by 
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \textit{Name save} which waits for a name to be given, and saves it to the database
        \item \textit{Name confirmed} replies with a welcome explanation message
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{Food log - text} is triggered when the user adds a meal to the log. It takes required parameters of food (as a list), quantities, and optional parameters of meal name and date
  \item \textit{Send food pic} waits for a Facebook Messenger Media object (a picture in our case) to trigger an action which runs image recognition. If no unique match is found, 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Send food pic - no} is triggered by the webhook whenever there is no clear candidate for classification of a picture
    \item \textit{Clarify food pic} recognises user's sending a clarification for what the food was, through a Facebook Messenger button. To make sure the button's message matches this intent and not the generic food logging, a \textit{messenger\_button} token is appended to the message payload
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Send food pic - yes} is launched whenever a picture is classified correctly, and just triggers the Analyse food pic intent
    \item \textit{Analyse food pic} takes the food content found in a picture received from the user, analyses and stores the result into a database
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{Help} matches a request for help with a few reminders of the chatbot's functionalities
  \item \textit{Date retrieval} is used to query for past food logs, taking just a date as a parameter. For logging purposes, with removal functionality to be implemented in the future,
  \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Date retrieval - false} will recognise when the user declares the food log for that day to be incorrect
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textit{What's my name} is mainly a debugging intent, to check if the chatbot has managed to successfully save the name for the current user in the database
  \item \textit{Sinkhole} is used for training purposes to redirect all the intents that were misclassified
\end{itemize}
Our chatbot defines the following entities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{meal} enumerates four different meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks
  \item \textit{quantity} contains a list of all the different measurement units for food
  \item \textit{meal-quantities} combines quantities with quantifiers (a, some, integers etc.)
  \item \textit{approximate-quantifier}
  \item \textit{date-ext} extends the \textit{@sys.date} object with today and tomorrow
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backend}
By default, the Dialogflow interface includes a small inline editor to implement some simple webhook logic. While the web interface is limiting for creating a backend of the complexity required, it's easy to export this example code to \textit{Google Cloud Functions} \cite{gcfwebsite}, Google's serverless cloud function service, and their own database, storage and analytics tool, Firebase. \\
The sample code consists of an Express.js \cite{expresswebsite} web server, which listens to POST requests sent from Dialogflow to route \textit{/webhook} route. The server then crafts the appropriate response as a JSON object, which triggers a reply through the chat client. The largest portion of the code is the \textit{action-handlers} dictionary, which associates a different function to provide a response for any of the Dialogflow intents. 

We started developing our webhook from this starting example in GCF, but we soon realised that a core requirement of our design, the ability to call up external APIs, was not possible under the free tier of Google Cloud. Thus, it was necessary to find a replacement. Some options that were considered were Apache OpenWhisk \footnote{https://openwhisk.apache.org}, Captain Duck Duck \footnote{https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck}, Amazon Web Service Lambda or Elastic Beanstalk \footnote{https://aws.amazon/com/products}, Dokku \footnote{https://github.com/dokku/dokku}, 1backend \footnote{https://github.com/1backend/1backend}. \\
In the end, Heroku \footnote{https://heroku.com} was selected as a solution because of its many productivity advantages. To select the popular Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution over all other alternatives, we took into consideration the mature tooling, the easy to use deployment infrastructure, which consists of simply pushing the code to a version controlled repository, the automatic inclusion of a free domain name, and simple (but barebone) scheduling functionality. Heroku offers both a free and a paid tier; for our purposes of creating a prototype, the free tier offers all required functionality; however, it would not be sufficient to power a chatbot infrastructure in a production setting, as there are limits to free users' capabilities, most notably a temporary suspension (and extensive wake up times) after an hour of inactivity.

Having moved to a full PaaS implementation, we were able to expand our program from a single file to several modules, which was necessary to avoid a large unwieldy single file, and allows us to compartmentalize between different types of functionality.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{index.js} is the main function for the Express server, it runs in a loop waiting to receive any requests, and serves a response for any predefined URLs. On a POST request to \textit{/webhook}, it will read the request body to find the action's name and parameters, and calls a function as defined in the \textit{actionHandlers} dictionary. Most intents match one-to-one to an inline function in this object, although some are defined in an external module
  \item \textit{messenger.js} contains output functions to send a reply to the user, either going through the Dialogflow API, or directly through the user's Facebook Messenger account (necessary for sending a message on a predetermined schedule, without a user initiating the conversation)
  \item \textit{picture.js} handles all intents related to pictures, from querying the \textit{clarifai} to handling incorrect or imprecise guesses.
  \item \textit{mongo.js} abstracts some of the low level database, like connecting to the database and querying the username
  \item \textit{analysis.js} deals with all food related activity, like querying the Nutritionix API and analyse users' dietary records
  \item \textit{strings.js} contains all messages the chatbot will send to the user, all collected in one file for ease of editing
  \item \textit{worker.js} defines a set of functions to run periodically, which will verify some information about each of the chatbot users, and send an appropriate message
\end{itemize}
The latter module, unlike all the others, does not export any of its functions, but runs every day at 8 AM GMT by the Heroku scheduler add-on.

We considered training our own food recognition model by training on the Food-101 dataset using the DeepFood Caffe model \cite{liu2016deepfood}, but after an initial evaluation it seemed ike precision would not be much better than \textit{clarifai}, so we opted to use the free service and save ourselves from training the model and store it on our server.
\subsubsection{Database}
When considering which database to use, the variety of offerings is truly staggering, so we decided to optimise for speed of development, by using a NoSQL database, which combines speed and scalability with the flexibility of not having to predefine a schema, an essential feature when building a prototype which has to undergo through several changes before finalising its design. While some chatbots designs integrate a graph database, which allows rapid aggregation over different entities, it was unnecessary for our current usagee, and we preferred to adopt a more widely used and better supported product.

Our final choice was a MongoDB database free instance hosted on \textit{mlab.com}. The database consist of a single collection, users, with a unique document for each user. \\
Besides containing identifying information such as a unique Dialogflow ID, a session ID to initiate messenger conversations and a name, we also store a list of \textit{meals}, which we defined as objects containing a list of food items, their quantities, a date, and an optional meal name (lunch, dinner, breakfast or snacks). \\
Finally, we have a \textit{counter} object, which stores values for the number of days since the user has logged any food, the number of days since the user has had any green leaf vegetables, and the total number of days. These are used to determine whether a reminder should be sent to that specific user about any of those issues (the total count reminder is used to ask for feedback about our experiment after three days, to collect some data while participants are still engaged with the chatbot).
\section{Roadblocks}
While we have developed and delivered a fully functional chatbot, there are many features that we would have liked to have but could not implement for lack of time. Other features were started, but could not be completed. \\
During our planning stage, for instance, we envisioned Healthbot to be able to answer some facts about the nutritional properties of any food the user would ask about, and to have the ability of adding recurring meals, so that if a user had a habit of having the same food every day they would not need to add it again and again. \\
We also started scripting some ``challenges'' the user could ask to be set, to improve their habits through gamifying the tracking activity; we explored options for both individual and group challenges.\\
Eventually, all of these projects had to be suspended because we had to prioritise the core features; for the other aspects listed below, we started working on an implementation, but encountered some obstacles.
\subsection{Instagram integration}
A unique feature of our initial chatbot design was its integration with \textit{Instagram}. If a user had an account on the social network, we would have asked them during the onboarding procedure to log into their account to generate a unique access key, which we would later have used to crawl their image history for food pictures.\\
We registered an Instagram developer account, created an applet on the platform, and developed the onboarding dialogue sequence, giving the user a choice on whether to sync their account. If logged in through a unique generated URL, they would be redirected to a custom address on our server which recorded their access token.

We completed our implementation of this first phase, and successfully tested the token generation on our own account. But as we were developing the crawler implementation, our application was suspended for Terms of Service violation. Speaking in person with Facebook employees, they speculated that the reason for the ban was that the picture retrieval API is only intended for building alternative clients, making our idea infeasible. \\
In hindsight, it was for the better we stopped working on this feature: during the evaluation period, following the fallback from journalistic investigation over Facebook's excessively permissive data sharing practices \cite{cambridgeanalytica}, the Instagram API was completely deprecated \cite{instagramdeprecated}.

An alternative with a more permissive API is \textit{Flickr} \cite{flickr}, but we did not explore the possibility of using this smaller social network.
\subsection{Defining a food entity}
The set of Dialogflow predefined entities does not include one for food. This is in fact a nontrivial problem, because enumerating all possible food requires knowing about both ``raw'' ingredients, and commercial food which might be referred to as their brand name or with a specific product denomination. We therefore tried to handcraft our own food corpus, in the hope it would provide sufficient coverage.

To collect food entities, we first used the Open Food Facts database \cite{openfoodfacts}. Besides being freely accessible, this option was selected because of the large number of entries, $374,259$, the presence of generic food identifiers associated with commercial product for 59,383 of the entries, and a nutritional approved health rating on a A to F scale. Moreover, besides a raw data export, the service provides an experimental JSON API for online queries. \\
The raw database was exported as a MongoDB \cite{mongo} object, in \textit{bson} format. After having created an empty \textit{openfooddata} table, using the \textit{mongoimport} command we copied the contents of this object in the new database. Then, through the mongo console, we wrote a script to extract all food with a name in English.
\begin{lstlisting}
var cursor = db.products.find( 
    {$and: [
      {$or: [
           {``generic_name'' :  {$ne: "", '$exists':true}},
           {``generic_name_en'' :  {$ne: "", '$exists':true}}
        ]},
      {"countries" : {$regex: ``en|UK|United States|Canada''}
    ]}
)

var cursor = db.products.find({$and: [{$or: [{"" :  {$ne: ", '$exists':true}},{"generic_name_en": {$ne: ", '$exists':true}}]}, {"countries" : {$regex: ``en|UK|United States|Canada''}}]})
while (myCursor.hasNext()) {
   printjson(myCursor.next());
}
\end{lstlisting}

Unfortunately, this produced only 795 food items which were indexed as being listed in English with a proper name, and manual testing for common foods resulted in several misses.\\
Subsequently, we found an online corpus of British raw food at LanguaL.org \cite{langual}(1316 items), but it was also insufficient for common queries. 

In the end, we decided to compromise and accept the risk of some false positives, deeming missing out on some uncommon foods more harmful. Our final approach was marking the food parameters as a \textit{@sys.any} entity, which is equivalent to a wildcard match. This is fine for a more structured intent, where the user prefaces tier logged food with an action verb (``I ate'', ``I had'' etc.), but these are not sufficient to capture the full range of inputs, as some users will also just say the name of the food. For those type of formulations, we had to add an intent case which just matches entity \textit{@sys.any}, but that obviously has the unwanted consequence of also catching utterances that match neither the intent nor the smalltalk module.
\subsection{Classifying food}
Just like our handcrafted leafy green vegetable set, we would have liked the capability of automatically recognise whenever food belonged to a certain category (meat, fish, nuts etc.), which we would have used to create a set of simple heuristics to detect food missing from the user's diet. \\
The apparently simple task of associating the name of a food to a category is deceptively complex; even humans assign multiple categories to the same food (e.g. fruit or snack for \textit{apple}), and thinking about a certain food as belonging to a certain category will influence their beliefs in regard to its nutritional properties \cite{Hayes2011}.

Our naive attempt to classify food  according to its category was to cluster it based on its nutritional values: ideally, similar kind of foods would have ended up being classified in the same clusters ("high in sugar", "high in proteins", "low in vitamins" etc.) and manual inspection of classified data could have been used to assign an intuitive category to each cluster. 

The \textit{k-means clustering} algorithm is used to group points in n-dimensional space into a predetermined $k$ clusters, by iteratively computing the cluster each point belongs to, based on a distance metric, until cluster membership becomes stable.\\
While our vector space was 250-dimensional, corresponding to the number of distinct nutritional values identified by the USDA nutritional database, it is not trivial to determine the value of $k$. If we had had a distinctive number of food groups we wanted to obtain (like, for instance, the 10 categories identified by the Australian National Nutrition Survey of 1995 \cite{NNS1995}), we could have used that as $k$, but obviously any kind of foods that belonged to a cluster we have not considered would have been incorrectly classified. Napoleon (2011)\cite{napoleon} describes an algorithm to both automatically select a value $k$, and to reduce the dimensionality of our data set. This allows us to reduce computation, by eliminating nutrients that do not contribute significantly to the classification, and is a necessary operation, because the size of our training set was too small compared to the dimension of each data point. Known in the literature as \textit{curse of dimensionality}, it can lead to a variety of issues that would make any classification meaningless \cite{kriegel2009}.\\
Once clusterings for the training set were calculated, any subsequent food the user logged would have been classified based on its distance from the calculated cluster centres.

We built a training dataset by fetching from the Nutritionix API the nutritional values of the 1316 foods in the LanguaL.org dataset, minus the 213 foods Nutritionix had no nutritional value on record for. The Nutritionix API returns a list of values of type (ID, quantity), where the ID Corresponds to nutritional values as identified by USDA. Because the free tier of the API is rate-limited to 200 requests per day, we wrote a script to break up the dataset into smaller chunks, download a portion of data every day, and recombine it. Having collected all our samples, we passed the data to a custom Node script to expand each food's value into a 250-dimensional vector. Then, using the \textit{mljs} library \footnote{https://github.com/mljs}, it would perform dimensionality reduction with PCA \cite{Ding2004}, find good starting cluster centres, and execute k-means clustering on the entire dataset through the \textit{clusterfck} library \footnote{https://github.com/tayden/clusterfck}. The cluster centres would then be saved to a file, for the purpose of being used by the application to classify new food. 

All attempts at classification, however, where disastrous. While we used the algorithm from Ding, 2004 \cite{Ding2004}, to dynamically identify the number of cluster centres with the highest variance (a number of 7 for our dataset), our results were only marginally better than other clusterings. For any number of clusters we tried, most datapoints would group around 2 or 3 cluster centres, with one centre attracting around 800 values, a few hundreds for the other two, and all other centres having between 10 and no value. This result is corroborated by Kim et al. (2015)\cite{Kim2015a}'s finding that foods of similar origins do not necessary cluster together when grouping based on raw nutritional values. Their proposed network classification and metrics of nutritional fitness do offer a potential method to recommend complementary meals for the chatbot, but deriving the full network from the provided dataset would have required a significant amount of time, and each query would also require calculations that would take so long as to make a chatbot unresponsive.

Automatic classification of foods into distinct groups is still an open question. Besides nutrient counts, alternative classification methods could be the usage of word embeddings in recipes \cite{food2vec}. While this might be a good way to find if two foods are culinarily related, it does not necessarily satisfy the property of nutritional equivalence, which is what we would ultimately want Healthbot to do.
Eftimov, 2017 \cite{Eftimov2017} developed an automatic classification method for European standard food classification system FoodEx2, which lists not only composition values, but also chemical contaminants, food consumption and pesticide residuals. Their algorithm goes through a classified learning phase and a probabilistic natural language extraction phase for description, which achieves a good accuracy of 89\%, but the resulting classification categories are too broad to be useful for our purposes.
