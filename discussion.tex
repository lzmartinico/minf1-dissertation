\section{Chatbot performance}
The nature of chatbot development is one of predicting what a user will say; this is a hard job for any large software development effort, and even harder for a single student.
Testing on our own account, using phrasings we knew the chatbot would recognise, was very different from deploying it in the wild, and experiencing all the different ways participants in the study tried to express the same concepts.

* sys.any didn't work
* circular conversations
* reminder failure
* add testers
* size recognition doesnt work
* multiple foods broken down by sizes and messages
* food api not working well (Long island ice tea)


During user evaluation, features were pointed out: clear record if incorrect food, add food on different date; users wanted more frequent reminders; didn't realise pictures capability, or lookback on food; reminders didn't work for the first 6 days, but when they were turned on 100\% of users went back in the same morning, and most sent a message after as well; bad interaction with follow ups

Features we want: recurring meals, GIFS, challenges


Through the implementation, it became evident how little privacy a chatbot user can expect. No e2e encryption, data shared among chat provider, nlp tools, databases, cloud hosting and analytics
