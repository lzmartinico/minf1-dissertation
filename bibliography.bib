abstract = {The objective of this paper was to develop a set of food groups for use in a self-administered, computer-assisted diet history interview for use in Australia by combining foods into groups so as to minimise database error in the macronutrient values for the food groups. The program needs to appropriately balance the level of detail used with the burden load on respondents and errors associated with categorisation of foods into groups. Various statistical techniques were utilised to aggregate a large number of food items into compositionally and conceptually similar groups. Exploratory statistical analysis, cluster analysis, stepwise regression analysis and association rule analysis were performed. A database containing 433 food groups was created which minimised the level of database error in the resulting data collection. Although some database error was introduced by aggregating food items into groups, the magnitude of the errors was reasonable considering other error sources. These findings are useful when applied to collection of food intake information for an individual's diet history and measurement of energy and macronutrient intake.

abstract = {There is a growing concern about chronic diseases and other health problems related to diet including obesity and cancer. The need to accurately measure diet (what foods a person consumes) becomes imperative. Dietary intake provides valuable insights for mounting intervention programs for prevention of chronic diseases. Measuring accurate dietary intake is considered to be an open research problem in the nutrition and health fields. In this paper, we describe a novel mobile telephone food record that will provide an accurate account of daily food and nutrient intake. Our approach includes the use of image analysis tools for identification and quantification of food that is consumed at a meal. Images obtained before and after foods are eaten are used to estimate the amount and type of food consumed. The mobile device provides a unique vehicle for collecting dietary information that reduces the burden on respondents that are obtained using more classical approaches for dietary assessment. We describe our approach to image analysis that includes the segmentation of food items, features used to identify foods, a method for automatic portion estimation, and our overall system architecture for collecting the food intake information.},

Some research was conducted in order to discover the problems related to the usage of PI tools, although none investigated how common users use these tools for tracking their behavior. The goal of this paper is to provide some insights about challenges and open issues regarding the usage of PI tools from the point of view of a common user.

abstract = {There is a growing interest in chatbots, which are machine agents serving as natural language user interfaces for data and service providers. However, no studies have empirically investigated people's motivations for using chatbots. In this study, an online questionnaire asked chatbot users (N = 146, aged 16--55 years) from the US to report their reasons for using chatbots. The study identifies key motivational factors driving chatbot use. The most frequently reported motivational factor is ``productivity''; chatbots help users to obtain timely and efficient assistance or information. Chatbot users also reported motivations pertaining to entertainment, social and relational factors, and curiosity about what they view as a novel phenomenon. The findings are discussed in terms of the uses and gratifications theory, and they provide insight into why people choose to interact with automated agents online. The findings can help developers facilitate better human--chatbot interaction experiences in the future. Possible design guidelines are suggested, reflecting different chatbot user motivations.},

abstract = {A variety of different dietary patterns can achieve the nutrient goals for a given population and therefore be considered as healthful. This means that guidelines for a healthy diet can be tailored to suit different cultures and food preferences. Although food-based dietary guidelines are used worldwide, there is also authoritative dietary advice in relation to single nutrients, especially those of public health relevance. This includes recommendations to eat less salt, free sugars and 'saturates' as well as more fibre. However, it can be difficult for consumers to make simultaneous reductions in salt, sugars and saturated fatty acids as well as increases in dietary fibre, given that food choices are made according to a variety of considerations, including taste preferences, culture, convenience and cost, as well as health. In addition, media coverage of new scientific findings, especially those that challenge current dietary guidelines, can confuse consumers and hamper efforts to eat healthfully. Both food-based dietary guidelines and recommended nutrient intakes can help consumers eat healthfully, providing they are supported by sound nutrition science, communicated well and delivered in a way that promotes beneficial changes in behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2015 British Nutrition Foundation.},

abstract = {Two studies examined multiple category reasoning in property induction with cross-classified foods. Pilot tests identified foods that were more typical of a taxonomic category (e.g., "fruit"; termed 'taxonomic primary') or a script based category (e.g., "snack foods"; termed 'script primary'). They also confirmed that taxonomic categories were perceived as more coherent than script categories. In Experiment 1 participants completed an induction task in which information from multiple categories could be searched and combined to generate a property prediction about a target food. Multiple categories were more often consulted and used in prediction for script primary than for taxonomic primary foods. Experiment 2 replicated this finding across a range of property types but found that multiple category reasoning was reduced in the presence of a concurrent cognitive load. Property type affected which categories were consulted first and how information from multiple categories was weighted. The results show that multiple categories are more likely to be used for property predictions about cross-classified objects when an object is primarily associated with a category that has low coherence.},

It has recently been adopted by WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Google Allo among many others; the first two of these have at least 1 billion active users. Signal includes several uncommon security properties (such as " future secrecy " or " post-compromise security "), enabled by a novel technique called ratcheting in which session keys are updated with every message sent. Despite its importance and novelty, there has been little to no academic analysis of the Signal protocol. We conduct the first security analysis of Signal's Key Agreement and Double Ratchet as a multi-stage key exchange protocol. We extract from the implementation a formal description of the abstract protocol, define a security model which can capture the " ratcheting " key update structure, and prove the security of Signal's core in our model. Our presentation and results can serve as a starting point for other analyses of this widely adopted protocol.},

abstract = {The European Food Safety Authority has developed a standardized food classification and description system called FoodEx2. It uses facets to describe food properties and aspects from various perspectives, making it easier to compare food consumption data from different sources and perform more detailed data analyses. However, both food composition data and food consumption data, which need to be linked, are lacking in FoodEx2 because the process of classification and description has to be manually performed—a process that is laborious and requires good knowledge of the system and also good knowledge of food (composition, processing, marketing, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a semi-automatic system for classifying and describing foods according to FoodEx2, which consists of three parts. The first involves a machine learning approach and classifies foods into four FoodEx2 categories, with two for single foods: raw (r) and derivatives (d), and two for composite foods: simple (s) and aggregated (c). The second uses a natural language processing approach and probability theory to describe foods. The third combines the result from the first and the second part by defining post-processing rules in order to improve the result for the classification part. We tested the system using a set of food items (from Slovenia) manually-coded according to FoodEx2. The new semi-automatic system obtained an accuracy of 89{\%} for the classification part and 79{\%} for the description part, or an overall result of 79{\%} for the whole system.},

abstract = {For nutrition practitioners and researchers, assessing dietary intake of children and adults with a high level of accuracy continues to be a challenge. Developments in mobile technologies have created a role for images in the assessment of dietary intake. The objective of this review was to examine peer-reviewed published papers covering development, evaluation and/or validation of image-assisted or image-based dietary assessment methods from December 2013 to January 2016. Images taken with handheld devices or wearable cameras have been used to assist traditional dietary assessment methods for portion size estimations made by dietitians (image-assisted methods). Image-assisted approaches can supplement either dietary records or 24-h dietary recalls. In recent years, image-based approaches integrating application technology for mobile devices have been developed (image-based methods). Image-based approaches aim at capturing all eating occasions by images as the primary record of dietary intake, and therefore follow the methodology of food records. The present paper reviews several image-assisted and image-based methods, their benefits and challenges; followed by details on an image-based mobile food record. Mobile technology offers a wide range of feasible options for dietary assessment, which are easier to incorporate into daily routines. The presented studies illustrate that image-assisted methods can improve the accuracy of conventional dietary assessment methods by adding eating occasion detail via pictures captured by an individual (dynamic images). All of the studies reduced underreporting with the help of images compared with results with traditional assessment methods. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better delineate attributes with regards to age of user, degree of error and cost.},

@article{Casperson2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Mobile technologies are emerging as valuable tools to collect and assess dietary intake. Adolescents readily accept and adopt new technologies; thus, a food record app (FRapp) may be a useful tool to better understand adolescents' dietary intake and eating patterns. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the amenability of adolescents, in a free-living environment with minimal parental input, to use the FRapp to record their dietary intake. METHODS Eighteen community-dwelling adolescents (11-14 years) received detailed instructions to record their dietary intake for 3-7 days using the FRapp. Participants were instructed to capture before and after images of all foods and beverages consumed and to include a fiducial marker in the image. Participants were also asked to provide text descriptors including amount and type of all foods and beverages consumed. RESULTS Eight of 18 participants were able to follow all instructions: included pre- and post-meal images, a fiducial marker, and a text descriptor and collected diet records on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. Dietary intake was recorded on average for 3.2 (SD 1.3 days; 68{\%} weekdays and 32{\%} weekend days) with an average of 2.2 (SD 1.1) eating events per day per participant. A total of 143 eating events were recorded, of which 109 had at least one associated image and 34 were recorded with text only. Of the 109 eating events with images, 66 included all foods, beverages and a fiducial marker and 44 included both a pre- and post-meal image. Text was included with 78 of the captured images. Of the meals recorded, 36, 33, 35, and 39 were breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that mobile devices equipped with an app to record dietary intake will be used by adolescents in a free-living environment; however, a minority of participants followed all directions. User-friendly mobile food record apps may increase participant amenability, increasing our understanding of adolescent dietary intake and eating patterns. To improve data collection, the FRapp should deliver prompts for tasks, such as capturing images before and after each eating event, including the fiducial marker in the image, providing complete and accurate text information, and ensuring all eating events are recorded and should be customizable to individuals and to different situations.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Self-monitoring of physical activity (PA) and diet are key components of behavioral weight loss programs. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between diet (mobile app, website, or paper journal) and PA (mobile app vs no mobile app) self-monitoring and dietary and PA behaviors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a post hoc analysis of a 6-month randomized weight loss trial among 96 overweight men and women (body mass index (BMI) 25-45 kg/m(2)) conducted from 2010 to 2011. Participants in both randomized groups were collapsed and categorized by their chosen self-monitoring method for diet and PA. All participants received a behavioral weight loss intervention delivered via podcast and were encouraged to self-monitor dietary intake and PA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Adjusting for randomized group and demographics, PA app users self-monitored exercise more frequently over the 6-month study (2.6±0.5 days/week) and reported greater intentional PA (196.4±45.9 kcal/day) than non-app users (1.2±0.5 days/week PA self-monitoring, p{\textless}0.01; 100.9±45.1 kcal/day intentional PA, p=0.02). PA app users also had a significantly lower BMI at 6 months (31.5±0.5 kg/m(2)) than non-users (32.5±0.5 kg/m(2); p=0.02). Frequency of self-monitoring did not differ by diet self-monitoring method (p=0.63); however, app users consumed less energy (1437±188 kcal/day) than paper journal users (2049±175 kcal/day; p=0.01) at 6 months. BMI did not differ among the three diet monitoring methods (p=0.20).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings point to potential benefits of mobile monitoring methods during behavioral weight loss trials. Future studies should examine ways to predict which self-monitoring method works best for an individual to increase adherence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today's generation of young adults are gaining weight faster than their parents; however, there remains insufficient evidence to inform interventions to prevent this weight gain. Mobile phones are a popular means of communication that may provide a convenient, inexpensive means to deliver health intervention programmes. This pilot study aimed to measure the effect of a 12-week mobile health (mHealth) intervention on body weight, body mass index and specific lifestyle behaviours addressed by the programme.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: University students and staff aged 18-35 years (n = 51) were randomised (ratio 1 : 1, intervention : control). Both groups received a printed diet booklet with instructions prepared by a dietitian. The intervention group also received Short Message Service (SMS) text messages (four per week), e-mails (four per week), and had access to smartphone applications and Internet forums.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Pre- to post-intervention, participants in the intervention group decreased their body weight [mean (SD)] [-1.6 (2.6) kg], increased their light intensity activity [34 (35) min day(-1) ] and reported an increased vegetable (1.0 median serving day(-1) ) and decreased sugar-sweetened beverage intake [-355 (836) mL week(-1) ]. Despite this, post-intervention changes in outcomes were not significantly different from controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The piloted mHealth programme provided some short-term positive changes in weight, nutrition and physical activity using a low cost, convenient delivery method for this population. However, changes were no different from those observed among controls. This might partly be explained by intervention participants' low engagement with the programme, which is likely to require further modification to provide more regular, personalised, monitored support.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for technical support of reflective learning, derived from a unification of reflective learning theory with a conceptual framework of Quantified Self tools -- tools for collecting personally relevant information for gaining self-knowledge. Reflective learning means returning to and evaluating past experiences in order to promote continuous learning and improve future experiences. Whilst the reflective learning theories do not sufficiently consider technical support, Quantified Self (QS) approaches are rather experimental and the many emergent tools are disconnected from the goals and benefits of their use. This paper brings these two strands into one unified framework that shows how QS approaches can support reflective learning processes on the one hand and how reflective learning can inform the design of new QS tools for informal learning purposes on the other hand.},

abstract = {Chatbots are “online human-computer dialog system[s] with natural language.” [1] The first conceptualization of the chatbot is attributed to Alan Turing, who asked “Can machines think?” in 1950. [3] Since Turing, chatbot technology has improved with advances in natural language processing and machine learning. Likewise, chatbot adoption has also increased, especially with the launch of chatbot platforms by Facebook [93], Kik [94], Slack [95], Skype [96], WeChat [97], Line [98], and Telegram [99]. By September 2016, Facebook Messenger hosted 30,000 bots and had 34,000 developers on its platform. [100] The Kik Bot Shop announced in August 2016 that the 20,000 bots created on its platform had “exchanged over 1.8 million messages.” [101] This paper is a literature review of the design choices, architecture, and algorithms used in chatbots. Section 1 will describe chatbot function and history in more detail and discuss the methods used to evaluate chatbots. Section 2, will walk through chatbot functionality step-by-step, beginning with automatic speech recognition (ASR) algorithms, natural language processing (NLP) functionality, response generation approaches, knowledge base creation strategies, and dialogue management (DM) algorithms, and concluding with a discussion of text to speech algorithms. Section 3 will focus on chatbot development, beginning with a case study of IBM Watson's chatbot functionality and concluding with a discussion of security considerations and chatbot applications.},

The simplest version assumes that the user is eating at a restaurant for which we know the menu. In this case, we can collect images offline to train a multi-label classifier. At run time, we apply the classifier (running on your phone) to predict which foods are present in your meal, and we lookup the corresponding nutritional facts. We apply this method to a new dataset of images from 23 different restaurants, using a CNN-based classifier, significantly outperforming previous work. The more challenging setting works outside of restaurants. In this case, we need to estimate the size of the foods, as well as their labels. This requires solving segmentation and depth / volume estimation from a single image. We present CNN-based approaches to these problems, with promising preliminary results. 1.},

abstract = {Clustering in high-dimensional spaces is a difficult problem which is recurrent in many domains, for example in image analysis. The difficulty is due to the fact that high-dimensional data usually exist in different low-dimensional subspaces hidden in the original space. A family of Gaussian mixture models designed for high-dimensional data which combine the ideas of subspace clustering and parsimonious modeling are presented. These models give rise to a clustering method based on the expectationmaximization algorithm which is called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC). In order to correctly fit the data, HDDC estimates the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of each group. Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that HDDC outperforms existing methods for clustering high-dimensional data.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to better understand the digital divide by identifying the variety of ways in which people in Europe use the Internet. First, by using cluster analysis on survey data (N=12,666/age: 1674 years) from Eurostat on Internet usage in Norway, Sweden, Austria, the UK, and Spain, we identified five user types: Non-Users (42{\%}), Sporadic Users (18{\%}), Instrumental Users (18{\%}), Entertainment Users (10{\%}), and Advanced Users (12{\%}). These user types differ in their distributions over country, age, access, household members, and gender. An alarming finding is that 60{\%} of the population was found to be either Non-Users or Sporadic Users, which reflects a large digital divide in Europe. Second, we conducted a logistic regression to identify the predictors for different user types. We found on a cross-national level that age and Internet access are the most salient predictors, whereas gender and household seems to be less relevant. However, the amount of variance explained differs between countries. We also suggested a future increase in the digital divide between the identified user types-a user type divide. The user typology and the identified predictors might help researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to better understand Internet users and the multi-complex variations among individuals and countries. This knowledge will also serve as a means to understand the digital divide by providing a more nuanced perspective on Europeans unequal usage of the Internet and participation in an increasingly digital society. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to outline the design of a chatbot to be used within mental health counselling. One of the main causes of the burden of disease worldwide is mental health problems. Mental health contributes to 28{\%} of the total burden of disease, compared to 16{\%} each for cancer and heart disease in the UK. Stress, anxiety or depression accounted for 15.8 million days of sickness absence across the UK in 2016. By 2020, the gap between the demand for mental health care and the resources the National Health Service (NHS) can provide is likely to widen, therefore providers are increasingly needing to find more cost-effective ways to deliver mental health care. Digital Interventions have been created to help with these issues, for example anxiety, stress and depression. Chatbots can be incorporated into digital interventions, or used as standalone interventions. Chatbots can be a more interactive experience for the user to receive information, or complete diagnostic tools, or to even be used for counselling. A demo chatbot was created using interactive emoji's and GIFs to improve the user experience when searching for online self-help tips. This chatbot will be further developed and incorporated into a full web based programme for mental health in the workplace. It is envisaged that the chatbot will be able to provide initial counselling, and lead users into the correct services or self-help information.},

abstract = {There are lot of treatments that are available for various diseases. No human can possibly know about all the medicines and the diseases. So, the problem is that there isn't any place where anyone can have the details of the diseases or the medicines. What if there is a place where you can find your health problem just by entering symptoms or just scanning an ECG or you can check whether the prescribed medicine is supposed to be used the way you are told to. Then it will help us to deduce the problem and to verify the solution. The proposed idea is to create a system with artificial intelligence that can meet the requirements. The AI can predict the diseases based on the symptoms and give the list of available treatments. The System can also give the composition of the medicines and their prescribed uses. It helps them to take the correct treatment. Hence the people can have an idea about their health and can have the right protection.},

What chatbot personalities are most compelling to young, urban users in India? To explore this question, we first conducted exploratory Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) studies with 14 users that simulated interactions with a hypothetical chatbot. We evaluated three personalities for the chatbot---Maya, a productivity oriented bot with nerd wit; Ada, a fun, flirtatious bot; and Evi, an emotional buddy bot. We followed up with one-on-one interviews with the users discussing their experiences with each of the chatbots, what they liked, and what they did not. Overall our results show that users wanted a chatbot like Maya, who could add value to their life while being a friend, by making useful recommendations. But they also wanted preferred traits of Ada and Evi infused into Maya.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Sleep disturbances are common in young people and have consequences for academic, social, emotional, and behavioral development. The most effective treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), with evidence suggesting that it is efficacious even when delivered digitally. OBJECTIVE There are no commercially available digitally delivered CBT-I programs for use by young people. The aim of this project was to develop a smartphone app that delivers CBT-I to young people to improve sleep. METHODS To inform the development of the app, young people (N=21) aged between 12 and 16 years attended one of the 3 focus groups (each with 4-10 participants). These focus groups were conducted at different stages of the development process such that the process could be iterative. Participants were asked the reasons why they might use an app to help them sleep, the kinds of features or functions that they would like to see in such an app, and any concerns they may have in using the app. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Of the issues discussed by the participants, the researchers selected themes associated with content, functionality, and accessibility and user experience to examine, as these were most informative for the app design process. RESULTS In terms of content, young people were interested in receiving information about recommended sleep guidelines and personalized information for their age group. They reported that keeping a sleep diary was acceptable, but they should be able to complete it flexibly, in their own time. They reported mixed views about the use of the phone's accelerometer. Young people felt that the functionality of the app should include elements of game playing if they were to remain engaged with the app. Flexibility of use and personalized features were also desirable, and there were mixed views about the schedule of notifications and reminders. Participants reported that for the app to be accessible and usable, it should be from a trusted developer, have engaging aesthetics, have a layout that is easy to navigate, not rely on Internet coverage, and preferably be free. Participants felt that being able to conceal the purpose of the app from peers was an advantage and were willing to provide personal information to use the app if the purpose and use of that information was made clear. Overall, participants endorsed the use of the app for sleep problems among their age group and reported motivation to use it. CONCLUSIONS The Sleep Ninja is a fully-automated app that delivers CBT-I to young people, incorporating the features and information that young people reported they would expect from this app. A pilot study testing the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the Sleep Ninja is now underway.},

@article{Følstad2017,
abstract = {A potential revolution is happening in front of our eyes. For decades, researchers and practitioners in human-computer interaction (HCI) have been improving their skills in designing for graphical user interfaces. Now things may take an unexpected turn—toward natural-language user interfaces, in which interaction with digital systems happens not through scrolling, swiping, or button clicks, but rather through strings of text in natural language. This is particularly visible in recent developments in chatbots, that is, machine agents serving as natural-language user interfaces to data and service providers [1], typically in the context of messaging applications. Need a reminder to pick up some flowers for your husband on the way home? Ask Jarvis the chatbot to remind you. Wonder if you should bring an umbrella to that meeting in Stockholm? Send Poncho the artificial weather cat a message and ask. If technology giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are right, we will be moving our digital interaction from websites and apps with graphical user interfaces to messaging platforms such as Messenger and Allo. If this happens, huge challenges and opportunities await in the field of HCI. Let's have a look at what is happening in the still relatively exotic world of chatbots. In early spring 2016, Microsoft presented its vision of conversations as a platform, where artificial intelligence (AI) and natural-language interaction allow new ways to experience interactive systems. As a step toward this vision, the company provided a framework for bot developers and launched the first chatbots on Skype. Microsoft, however, is far from alone in holding visions of natural-language interaction. At about the same time, Facebook launched facilities for building chatbots for its messaging application, Messenger. Already, tens of thousands of chatbots have appeared on Messenger. Though the vast majority of these are useful or entertaining for only a tiny group of people—maybe only their developers—some pleasant surprises point to the opportunities ahead. For example, Smokey warns you when the air quality in your city drops below acceptable levels; Instalocate helps you stay updated on your upcoming flights; and Jessie Humani takes you for an entertaining ride through the everyday life of young adults. Then there is Google Assistant, a chatbot integrated in the Allo messaging application and recent versions of the Android operating system that outperforms all the others, though it too can be pretty dumb at times. Google Assistant reliably helps you out with questions in natural language, such as when the sun sets or where to find the nearest coffee shop, even when asked follow-up questions for directions or opening hours. Yet conversations break down fast enough for this to be an interface for only the most enthusiastic of techies. It is no mystery why the major technology companies see chatbots as the next big thing. Mobile messaging applications now have more than 1.5 billion users worldwide [2], and they are competing with social networks as the main user interface to the Internet. For many users, natural language is already the default mode of interaction online, only there, the interaction is typically between human users through a machine interface. At the same time, advances in AI mean that natural-language interaction may be a feasible option for connecting machine agents and human users [3]. This already is visible in Twitter, a service that is welcoming to machine agents to the extent that this has become a social network arena for humans and bots alike. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it was estimated that more than one-fifth of the tweets using the main election hashtags},

@article{Kim2015a,
abstract = {Recent progresses in data-driven analysis methods, including network-based approaches, are revolutionizing many classical disciplines. These techniques can also be applied to food and nutrition, which must be studied to design healthy diets. Using nutritional information from over 1,000 raw foods, we systematically evaluated the nutrient composition of each food in regards to satisfying daily nutritional requirements. The nutrient balance of a food was quantified and termed nutritional fitness; this measure was based on the food's frequency of occurrence in nutritionally adequate food combinations. Nutritional fitness offers a way to prioritize recommendable foods within a global network of foods, in which foods are connected based on the similarities of their nutrient compositions. We identified a number of key nutrients, such as choline and $\alpha$-linolenic acid, whose levels in foods can critically affect the nutritional fitness of the foods. Analogously, pairs of nutrients can have the same effect. In fact, two nutrients can synergistically affect the nutritional fitness, although the individual nutrients alone may not have an impact. This result, involving the tendency among nutrients to exhibit correlations in their abundances across foods, implies a hidden layer of complexity when exploring for foods whose balance of nutrients within pairs holistically helps meet nutritional requirements. Interestingly, foods with high nutritional fitness successfully maintain this nutrient balance. This effect expands our scope to a diverse repertoire of nutrient-nutrient correlations, which are integrated under a common network framework that yields unexpected yet coherent associations between nutrients. Our nutrient-profiling approach combined with a network-based analysis provides a more unbiased, global view of the relationships between foods and nutrients, and can be extended towards nutritional policies, food marketing, and personalized nutrition.},

abstract = {By most standards, almost all American diets are in need of improvement. Given interest in using Federal nutrition assistance programs to promote healthy choices, some suggest that food stamp recipients should be prohibited from using their benefits to buy foods with limited nutritional value. However, there are serious problems with the rationale, feasibility and potential effectiveness of this proposal. No clear standards exist for defining foods as good or bad, or healthy or not healthy. • Federal dietary guidance uniformly applies to the total diet – there are no widely accepted standards to judge the " healthfulness " of individual foods. • Foods contain many components that can affect health, and diets contain many foods. As a result, it is challenging to determine whether – and the point at which – the presence or absence of desirable nutrients outweighs the presence of nutrients to be avoided in ruling a food " in " or " out " . Implementation of food restrictions would increase program complexity and costs. • There are more than 300,000 food products on the market, and an average of 12,000 new products were introduced each year between 1990 and 2000. The task of identifying, evaluating, and tracking the nutritional profile of every food available for purchase would be substantial. The burden of identifying which products met Federal standards would most likely fall on an expanded bureaucracy or on manufacturers and producers asked to certify that their products meet Federal standards. • Responsibility for enforcing compliance would rest in the hands of employees at check-out counters in 160,000 stores across the nation. While many have modern scanning and inventory control systems, others – especially small stores and specialty markets – do not. • New effort would be needed to help participants avoid the rejection of purchases at the check-out counter, an event with the potential to reduce productivity at the register and stigmatize participants. Restrictions may be ineffective in changing the purchases of food stamp participants • About 70 percent of all food stamp participants – those who receive less than the maximum benefit – are expected to purchase a portion of their food with their own money. There is no guarantee that restricting the use of food stamps would affect food purchases – other than substituting one form of payment (cash) for another (food stamps). No evidence exists that food stamp participation contributes to poor diet quality or obesity. • There is no strong research-based evidence to support restricting food stamp benefits. Food stamp recipients are no more likely than higher income consumers to choose foods with little nutritional value; thus the basis for singling out low-income food stamp recipients and restricting their food choices is not clear. There are better ways to work towards the goal of healthier diets that do not require such restrictions. Incentives – rather than restrictions – that encourage purchases of certain foods or expanded nutrition education to enable participants to make healthy choices are more practical options and likely to be more effective in achieving the dietary improvements that promote good health.},

abstract = {Background. Treating multiple health behavior risks on a population basis is one of the most promising approaches to enhancing health and reducing health care costs. Previous research demonstrated the efficacy of expert system interventions for three behaviors in a population of parents. The interventions provide individualized feedback that guides participants through the stages of change for each of their risk behaviors. This study extended that research to a more representative population of patients from primary care practice and to targeting of four rather than three behaviors. Methods. Stage-based expert systems were applied to reduce smoking, improve diet, decrease sun exposure, and prevent relapse from regular mammography. A randomized clinical controlled trial recruited 69.2{\%} of primary care patients (N = 5407) at home via telephone. Three intervention contacts were delivered for each risk factor at 0, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome measures were the percentages of at-risk patients at baseline who progressed to the action or maintenance stages at 24-month follow-up for each of the risk behaviors. Results. Significant treatment effects were found for each of the four behaviors, with 25.4{\%} of intervention patients in action or maintenance for smoking, 28.8{\%} for diet, and 23.4{\%} for sun exposure. The treatment group had less relapse from regular mammography than the control group (6{\%} vs. 10{\%}). Conclusion.

The study of emotions in human - computer interaction has increased in recent years in an attempt to address new user needs . At the same time , it is possible to record brain activity in real - time and discover patterns to relate it to emotional states . This paper describes a machine learning approach to detect emotion from brain activity , recorded as elec - troencephalograph (EEG) with the Emotic Epoc device , during auditory stimulation . First , we extract features from the EEG signals in order to characterize states of mind in the arousal - valence 2D emotion model . Us - ing these features we apply machine learning techniques to classify EEG signals into high / low arousal and positive / negative valence emotional states . The obtained classifiers may be used to categorize emotions such as happiness , anger , sadness , and calm based on EEG data .},

abstract = {For nutrition practitioners and researchers, assessing dietary intake of children and adults with a high level of accuracy continues to be a challenge. Developments in mobile technologies have created a role for images in the assessment of dietary intake. The objective of this review was to examine peer-reviewed published papers covering development, evaluation and/or validation of image-assisted or image-based dietary assessment methods from December 2013 to January 2016. Images taken with handheld devices or wearable cameras have been used to assist traditional dietary assessment methods for portion size estimations made by dietitians (image-assisted methods). Image-assisted approaches can supplement either dietary records or 24-h dietary recalls. In recent years, image-based approaches integrating application technology for mobile devices have been developed (image-based methods). Image-based approaches aim at capturing all eating occasions by images as the primary record of dietary intake, and therefore follow the methodology of food records. The present paper reviews several image-assisted and image-based methods, their benefits and challenges; followed by details on an image-based mobile food record. Mobile technology offers a wide range of feasible options for dietary assessment, which are easier to incorporate into daily routines. The presented studies illustrate that image-assisted methods can improve the accuracy of conventional dietary assessment methods by adding eating occasion detail via pictures captured by an individual (dynamic images). All of the studies reduced underreporting with the help of images compared with results with traditional assessment methods. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better delineate attributes with regards to age of user, degree of error and cost.},

Finally, the health risks of mobile phone use are addressed, as are several unresolved technical and policy-related issues unique to mobile phones. Because these issues may influence how well and how quickly mobile phones are integrated into health care, and how well they serve the needs of the entire population, they deserve the attention of both the healthcare and public health community.},

abstract = {While smartphones and related mobile technologies are recognized as flexible and powerful tools that, when used prudently, can augment human cognition, there is also a growing perception that habitual involvement with these devices may have a negative and lasting impact on users' ability to think, remember, pay attention, and regulate emotion. The present review considers an intensifying, though still limited, area of research exploring the potential cognitive impacts of smartphone-related habits, and seeks to determine in which domains of functioning there is accruing evidence of a significant relationship between smartphone technology and cognitive performance, and in which domains the scientific literature is not yet mature enough to endorse any firm conclusions. We focus our review primarily on three facets of cognition that are clearly implicated in public discourse regarding the impacts of mobile technology – attention, memory, and delay of gratification – and then consider evidence regarding the broader relationships between smartphone habits and everyday cognitive functioning. Along the way, we highlight compelling findings, discuss limitations with respect to empirical methodology and interpretation, and offer suggestions for how the field might progress toward a more coherent and robust area of scientific inquiry.​},

The simplest version assumes that the user is eating at a restaurant for which we know the menu. In this case, we can collect images offline to train a multi-label classifier. At run time, we apply the classifier (running on your phone) to predict which foods are present in your meal, and we lookup the corresponding nutritional facts. We apply this method to a new dataset of images from 23 different restaurants, using a CNN-based classifier, significantly outperforming previous work. The more challenging setting works outside of restaurants. In this case, we need to estimate the size of the foods, as well as their labels. This requires solving segmentation and depth / volume estimation from a single image. We present CNN-based approaches to these problems, with promising preliminary results. 1.},

abstract = {The recent proliferation of wearable self-tracking devices intended to regulate and measure the body has brought contingent questions of controlling, accessing and interpreting personal data. Given a socio-technical context in which individuals are no longer the most authoritative source on data about themselves, wearable self-tracking technologies reflect the simultaneous commodification and knowledge-making that occurs between data and bodies. In this article, we look specifically at wearable, self-tracking devices in order to set up an analytical comparison with a key historical predecessor, the weight scale. By taking two distinct cases of self-tracking – wearables and the weight scale – we can situate current discourses of big data within a historical framing of self-measurement and human subjectivity. While the advertising promises of both the weight scale and the wearable device emphasize self-knowledge and control through external measurement, the use of wearable data by multiple agents and institutions results in a lack of control over data by the user. In the production of self-knowledge, the wearable device is also making the user known to others, in a range of ways that can be both skewed and inaccurate. We look at the tensions surrounding these devices for questions of agency, practices of the body, and the use of wearable data by courtrooms and data science to enforce particular kinds of social and individual discipline.},

abstract = {Chatbot has become an important solution to rapidly increasing customer care demands on social media in recent years. However, current work on chatbot for customer care ignores a key to impact user experience - tones. In this work, we create a novel tone-aware chatbot that generates toned responses to user requests on social media. We first conduct a formative research, in which the effects of tones are studied. Significant and various influences of different tones on user experience are uncovered in the study. With the knowledge of effects of tones, we design a deep learning based chatbot that takes tone information into account. We train our system on over 1.5 million real customer care conversations collected from Twitter. The evaluation reveals that our tone-aware chatbot generates as appropriate responses to user requests as human agents. More importantly, our chatbot is perceived to be even more empathetic than human agents.},

abstract = {Today's globally networked society places great demand on the dissemination and sharing of$\backslash$nperson-specific data for many new and exciting uses. Even situations where aggregate statistical$\backslash$ninformation was once the reporting norm now rely heavily on the transfer of microscopically detailed$\backslash$ntransaction and encounter information. This happens at a time when more and more historically public$\backslash$ninformation is also electronically available. When these data are linked together, they provide an$\backslash$nelectronic shadow of a person or organization that is as identifying and personal as a fingerprint even$\backslash$nwhen the information contains no explicit identifiers, such as name and phone number. Other distinctive$\backslash$ndata, such as birth date and ZIP code, often combine uniquely and can be linked to publicly available$\backslash$ninformation to re-identify individuals. Producing anonymous data that remains specific enough to be$\backslash$nuseful is often a very difficult task and practice today tends to either incorrectly believe confidentiality is$\backslash$nmaintained when it is not or produces data that are practically useless.$\backslash$nThe goal of the work presented in this book is to explore computational techniques for releasing$\backslash$nuseful information in such a way that the identity of any individual or entity contained in data cannot be$\backslash$nrecognized while the data remain practically useful. I begin by demonstrating ways to learn information$\backslash$nabout entities from publicly available information. I then provide a formal framework for reasoning$\backslash$nabout disclosure control and the ability to infer the identities of entities contained within the data. I$\backslash$nformally define and present null-map, k-map and wrong-map as models of protection. Each model$\backslash$nprovides protection by ensuring that released information maps to no, k or incorrect entities, respectively.$\backslash$nThe book ends by examining four computational systems that attempt to maintain privacy while$\backslash$nreleasing electronic information. These systems are: (1) my Scrub System, which locates personallyidentifying$\backslash$ninformation in letters between doctors and notes written by clinicians; (2) my Datafly II$\backslash$nSystem, which generalizes and suppresses values in field-structured data sets; (3) Statistics Netherlands'$\backslash$nm-Argus System, which is becoming a European standard for producing public-use data; and, (4) my k-$\backslash$nSimilar algorithm, which finds optimal solutions such that data are minimally distorted while still$\backslash$nproviding adequate protection. By introducing anonymity and quality metrics, I show that Datafly II can$\backslash$noverprotect data, Scrub and m-Argus can fail to provide adequate protection, but k-similar finds optimal$\backslash$nresults.},

For all tasks, our language-based models significantly outperform the majority-class baselines. Performance is further improved with more complex natural language processing, such as topic modeling. We analyze which textual features have most predictive power for these datasets, providing insight into the connections between the language of food, geographic locale, and community characteristics. Lastly, we design and implement an online system for real-time query and visualization of the dataset.

abstract = {This paper presents a research of constructing a web-based expert system for nutrition diagnosis by utilizing the expert system techniques in artificial intelligence. The research implements Nutritional Care Process and Model (NCPM) defined by American Dietetic Association (ADA) in 2008 and integrate the nutrition diagnosis knowledge from dietetics professionals to establish the basics of building the rule-based expert system with its knowledge base. The system is built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 on.NET Framework 3.5SP1 utilizing the built in rule engine which comes with Windows Workflow Foundation. With the help of this system, it is easier for dietetics professionals to adapt to the newly introduced concept of nutrition diagnosis. At the heart of the web based expert system is a knowledge base, it has a rule engine which contains the nutrition diagnosis rules converted from signs and symptoms for nutrition diagnosis from dietetics professionals and are expressed in XML format which are then stored in a SQL database. A knowledge engineer will be able to use a rule editor to add new rules or to update existing rules within the rule database. Dietetics professionals would be able to enter patient's basic data, anthropometric data, physical exam findings, biochemical data, and food/nutrition history into the program. After dietetics professionals complete nutrition assessment, the program will make inference to the rule base and make nutrition diagnosis. Dietetics professionals could then make the final diagnosis decision for the patient based on the diagnosis report generated by the web based nutrition diagnosis expert system. For this study, I have selected 100 chronic kidney disease patients under hemodialysis from a university hospital, recorded their albumin, cholesterol, creatinine before dialysis, height, and dry weight and then use these data to perform nutrition diagnosis with both the expert system and a practicing dietitian. After comparing the result, I found that the expert system is faster and more accurate than human dietitian. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {DeltaHedron Innovation Insight is a regular newsletter exploring aspects of the technological future and technological innovation, with a specific focus on the strategic business opportunities, threats, risks and impact presented by emerging technologies and the dynamics of technological change Executive summary • A number of recent developments in emerging digital health technologies are considered in this newsletter. Telehealth and mHealth enable patients to access healthcare remotely. The resulting 'empowerment of the patient' is disrupting the industry and radically transforming the delivery, scope, quality and cost of, as well as access to, healthcare in developed and developing countries. Digital health technologies are dynamic with rapid changes in their performance, costs, applications and user bases. The industry structure is changing as are cost curves, business models and the power and influence patterns amongst role players. Significant new value is being created and new outcomes enabled. • Emerging digital health technologies should be high on the radar of companies as they assess strategic business opportunities, threats and risks. Traditional healthcare providers (including professional practitioners, hospitals and clinics), health insurers, funders, healthcare systems and producers of health technology products as well as new entrants and new types of entrants in the healthcare sector need to be aware of the disruptive shifts in the industry. Opportunities also abound for role players in other sectors that may, at first blush, not seem to be related or affected. Conversely, emerging digital technologies may also present risks and threats to role players in seemingly unrelated sectors. A strategic opportunity/threat/risk review is helpful to assess a specific company's or industry sector's technological innovation-related opportunities and vulnerabilities vis-{\`{a}}-vis emerging digital health technologies. • The ability to communicate wirelessly via 3G and 4G (and soon 5G) as well as through routed wifi networks, position mobile devices (such as smart phones or smart watches) as ideal mHealth platforms. Many sensors and features that are useful in mHealth applications are already imbedded in the mobile device itself, including clocks, flash lights, microphones, cameras, geo-position sensors (GPS) and accelerometers. Additional sensors can be integrated into a peripheral device (such as a scale or blood pressure monitor) connected to and communicating with the mobile device, typically through bluetooth. Recent reports mention mobile and portable sensors that can measure weight and body temperature, blood pressure and sugar levels, oxygen level and blood oxygenation, heart rate, rhythms and conditions, speech patterns, spectrometry, spirometry, dental parameters, cells structures of food, taste, blood alcohol content, sperm count, activity level and sleep quality; as well as ambient parameters such as pollution and noise. • mHealth, either locally through an app in the mobile device or through remote access, provides the capability to interpret the inputs from these sensors and then to identify and treat a range of clinical conditions. This information can be made available directly to the patient, often in real-time. Diabetes, hypertension, heart conditions, cancer, skin diseases, seizures and epilepsy, pain management, male fertility, mental health and home care are amongst many conditions recent reported on. Related reports also cover a range of wellness and fitness issues (including fatigue and substance abuse, which have important applications in industrial settings). DeltaHedron Innovation Insight Developments in emerging digital health technologies No 1.1/17 April 2017 2 {\textcopyright} DeltaHedron 2017 • The disruptive impacts of emerging technologies often come from completely different industries than those they disrupt. The impact of a specific emerging technology can be enabled, enhanced and amplified (or alternatively hindered) by its interaction with other technologies, specifically also other emerging technologies. Recent reports refer to applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual reality, imaging, internet of things, robotics, chatbots, 3-D printing and drones interacting with digital health technologies. • Health information is the lifeblood of digital health technologies, and significant effort is being directed towards capturing, communicating, storing, sharing, protecting, processing, interpreting and displaying the information. It is one the most significant drivers for strategic business opportunities and threats presented by emerging digital health technologies. The focus is on actionable information and decision support to patients, healthcare providers and other role players – everywhere, any time and in real-time. Recent reports focus on the use of remote patient monitoring (RPM), big data and health analytics, data security (including blockchain), patient generated health data (PGHD) and electronic health records (EHR). Interoperability of datasets remains problematic. • Many challenges and uncertainties remain to be resolved for emerging digital health technologies, as would be expected of any emerging technology. Apart from the technical and clinical challenges, issues pertaining to ethics, liability, data security, policies and regulation need to be addressed. The vexing problem of business models and the 'difficulties of making money' from telehealth and mHealth are important, as are the related issues of funding models and reimbursement of claims for digital health provision. These difficulties are complicated by the fact that traditional business models don't work very well in a platform-enabled, digital health world driven by new types of information and empowered patients. • As digital health, telehealth and mHealth become more ubiquitous, the nature of health-related jobs will necessarily also change. Inevitably new types of roles will emerge and current roles may disappear. One can, for example, imagine new and different roles for healthcare providers such as doctors, nurses and therapists. It is also necessary to consider how curricula for training healthcare professionals in the new digital health world should be developed and proactively adopted by universities and other education and training institutions. Accreditation bodies that regulate health qualifications and register professionals should also address this matter. It is important to ensure that the next generation of healthcare providers as well as the current practioners are prepared, able and willing to leverage the benefits of the new technologies. This will require not only an understanding of the new technologies and the skills to use them, but also a deeper understanding of the notion of the 'empowered patient' and how that will affect the relationships between patients and healthcare providers. Continual professional training in digital health technologies for practising professionals should be a high priority.},

abstract = {Logging food and calorie intake has been shown to facilitate weight management. Unfortunately, current food logging methods are time-consuming and cumbersome, which limits their effectiveness. To address this limitation, we present an automated computer vision system for logging food and calorie intake using images. We focus on the "restaurant" scenario, which is often a challenging aspect of diet management. We introduce a key insight that addresses this problem specifically: restaurant plates are often both nutritionally and visually consistent across many servings. This insight provides a path to robust calorie estimation from a single RGB photograph: using a database of known food items together with restaurant-specific classifiers, calorie estimation can be achieved through identification followed by calorie lookup. As demonstrated on a challenging Menu-Match dataset and an existing third party dataset, our approach outperforms previous computer vision methods and a commercial calorie estimation app. Our Menu-Match dataset of realistic restaurant meals is made publicly available.},
